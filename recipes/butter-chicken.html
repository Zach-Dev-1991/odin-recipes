  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani, is an Indian dish originating in Delhi. It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce.</p>
  <p>Butter chicken is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.</p>
  <h2>Recipe</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
    <li>1 onion, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tanoori masala</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Recipe</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook slowly until the onion caramelizes to a dark brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, combine cream, tomato sauce, remaining butter, salt, cayenne pepper, and garam masala in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Stir in caramelized onions.</li>
    <li>While the sauce is simmering, toss chicken with vegetable oil until coated. Season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
